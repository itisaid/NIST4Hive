His job is to document the trajectory of cattle and correlate the loft and acceleration versus the quality of materials used in the trebuchet.  He served ten years as the vice-president in charge of marketing in the now defunct milk trust of the Pennsylvania Coalition of All Things Bovine.  Prior to that he established himself as a world-class graffiti artist and source of all good bits related to channel dredging in poor weather.  He is author of over ten thousand paperback novels, including such titles as "How Many Pumpkins will Fit on the Head of a Pin," "A Whole Bunch of Useless Things that you Don't Want to Know," and "How to Lift Heavy Things Over your Head without Hurting Yourself or Dropping Them."
